  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I bring a dogged persistence with my military background and a knack for creative solutions from working in computer technical support. I produce enterprise-quality, rigorously-tested components with documentation even non-technical people can understand. I am pursuing a degree in website design to further augment the value I bring to future teams.</p>
